This is a food ordering app I’m building while learning **React**.  
It’s still a work in progress – not responsive yet, and more features are on the way.  
Right now, it can fetch live restaurant data from Swiggy’s API, show a loading shimmer, and lets you search or filter restaurants.

---

## ✨ Features so far
- Search restaurants by name  
- Filter top-rated ones (rating > 4.3)  
- Restaurant cards with name, cuisines, cost, rating & location  
- Shimmer effect while loading data  
- About page & Contact form  
- Error page for wrong routes  

---

## 🛠 Tech Used
- **React** (hooks + functional components)  
- **React Router** for navigation  
- **Plain CSS** for styling  

---

## 📌 Project Status
This is mainly a **practice project** while I learn React.  
I’ll add responsiveness, cart functionality, and maybe authentication in future updates.

## 🚀 How to run locally
1. Clone the repo

   ```
3. Install dependencies

   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) in your browser to see the app.
